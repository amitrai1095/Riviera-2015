Mrs. Mary Sullivan was found mysteriously murdered in her apartment at 10:30 pm on a Saturday night. The apartment number is 221B. Mr Sullivan was 10 minutes away from the apartment attending a party which was being held in his honour. Mr Sullivan has a perfect alibi: Everybody in the room could swear that Mr. S was in the party till 10: 30 as he was still performing his act and was on the stage. He was seen again at 10:45pm, at exactly 10:45 pm, Mr. S entered the front doors exclaiming that somebody had punctured the tyres of his car and strangely, he entered the room with burning fingers, and long parchments of paper which were rolled into hollow cylinders.

Enough material comprising of scientific facts and details would be provided to put forward a strong case in front of the judge. The main objective is to dissect the magician\'s tricks into minor technical facts and logic.

There is a Wheel of Fortune which is a roulette-style wheel mechanism with 24 spaces, most of which are labeled with points plus a jackpot point value. The Wheel also features two Bankrupt wedges and one Lose a Turn, both of which forfeit the contestant\'s turn, with the former also eliminating any point the contestant has accumulated in the previous round. Each game features three contestants of the same team. A contestant spins the wheel to determine a point value and guesses a consonant. Calling a correct letter earns the value before his or her corresponding flipper, multiplied by how many times the guessed letter appears in the puzzle. At any time during a turn, a contestant with sufficient money may buy a vowel for some point value until all the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant\'s control; hitting Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, calling a letter that is not in the puzzle, calling a letter that has already been called in that round, or giving an incorrect answer; all pass the control to the next player. The only exception is the Free Play wedge being marked in the wheel corresponding to which, there will be no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.The wheel contains another special tag: the Wild Card, which can be used to call an additional consonant by the contestant after any turn.At any point in the game, a contestant can guess the entire phrase.
